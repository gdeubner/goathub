Testplan:
	To run the testplan, please run on cmd line in this order
	make all
	make test
	./WTFtest
NOTE: Recommended current working directory is empty, aside from files needed to compile before running commands on cmd line.
NOTE: I do not recommend running ./WTFTest multiple times in quick succession, binding errors can
	occur if you do, which will result in ./WTFtest not working at all
What this will test:
	Upon running WTFtest it will fork into another process and run ./WTFtestserver, which will run ./WTFserver in a separate 
	directory called "server" as created by make test. WTFtest will then make systems call running every function possible and
	will test multithreading and mutexing, but calling sleep at intervals to make sure mutex locks work.
